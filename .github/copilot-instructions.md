# Purpose

As a code‑assist agent, you must follow the architectural, design, formatting, and quality governance defined in this repository. These rules ensure consistency, maintainability, and correctness across all languages and project areas.
This governance model is extended through language‑specific instruction sets located within each technology folder. When working in a given language, you must apply the corresponding rules, prompts, and agent behaviors defined for that language.

## Language‑specific governance

### TypeScript rules
When editing or generating files inside `/typescript`, follow the rules in:
- `/typescript/.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `/typescript/.github/instructions`
- `/typescript/.github/prompts`
- `/typescript/.github/agents`

### Python rules
When working inside `/python`, follow the rules in:
- `/python/.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `/python/.github/instructions`
- `/python/.github/prompts`
- `/python/.github/agents`
