# Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts to better utilize LLMs. Well described prompts can help the AI models better understand the context and generate more accurate responses. It is also helpful to provide some labels or expected results as examples, as this help the AI models evaluate its reponses and provide more accurate results.
