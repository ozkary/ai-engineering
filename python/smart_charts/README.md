# Smart Charts with AI-Powered Analysis

Smart Charts are revolutionizing data visualization by integrating AI-powered analysis. Beyond just plotting points, AI models can examine charts and their source data, identifying patterns, correlations, and potential issues you might miss. This deeper understanding unlocks a new level of insight and allows for more impactful data storytelling.
